Hi, my name is Viet Than. I am from Vietnam, but currently in the US (until they kick me out I guess).

I started programming relatively late during my junior year at Vanderbilt University (switching from ChemEng to CompSci), but I learnt to love exploring it. I think most people will find programmers/engineers very opinionated, and they always bring evidence. This logbook is a result of the disparate learning I do, as such it's very work-in-progress, and very stream-of-conciousness. 

My [GitHub](https://github.com/VietThan) would be a more structure presentation of what I do. While my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viet-than) would tell you what I am paid to do.

Enjoy!
