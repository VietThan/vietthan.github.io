If a durable 75% majority of Americans supported reinstating slavery of a specific ethnic/racial group, it would be madness to expect the other 25% to simply accept this outcome because them's the rules, so whaddya gonna do? If you convince people that they do not have a reasonable hope of achieving their preferences through the political system, they will work to achieve those preferences through other systems.
