>"Friends come and go, but a good enemy stays with you forever."
- Hagar the Horrible

>Ever since man first left his cave and met a stranger with a different language and a new way of looking at things, the human race has had a dream: to kill him, so we don't have to learn his language or his new way of looking at things.
