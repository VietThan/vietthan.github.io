I browsed the top of [/r/netsec](https://old.reddit.com/r/netsec/) yesterday night. I am in awe really. There is...

....the work of Sam Curry [hacking Apple for 3 months](https://samcurry.net/hacking-apple/) with his team and submitted 55 vulnerabilities to get a total of over 280k in bounty payout.

...and this [Quora answer on Stuxnet as the most sophisticated software ever](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-sophisticated-piece-of-software-ever-written-1/answer/John-Byrd-2) written by John Byrd (of Sega Dreamcast fame)

...or this junior high schooler [breaking GitHub private pages](https://robertchen.cc/blog/2021/04/03/github-pages-xss) in the spare time of Covid and got some nice pocket money.

...or even the write up by Troy Hunt on another [data breach being included in the pwnd database](https://www.troyhunt.com/inside-the-cit0day-breach-collection/).


This world is amazing. This could be the closest I'll be to a ninja spy. lol.
