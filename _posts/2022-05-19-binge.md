About 4-5 weeks ago, it started with [Legend of the Northern Blade](https://old.reddit.com/r/NorthernBlade/), well really it starts with [/r/manga](https://old.reddit.com/r/manga/). Now, of course that little few chapters won't get me anywhere, so next came [Red Storm](https://old.reddit.com/r/Red_Storm/) cause it's martial arts, and ki, and that was oh so so exciting! But the ending was a little weird, and the mentor character was interesting but not explained, thankfully there is [Peerless Dad](https://old.reddit.com/r/PeerlessDad/) which is set in the same universe. That was Korean, and martial arts excitement hasn't ended, of course we've got to at least check out [Gosu S2](https://old.reddit.com/r/Gosu_The_Master/) a little bit. At this point, I am a little bored with manga/pictures, so we have to swtich to webnovels of course. The first one was [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/), but that was dark and depressing by the end. Not like horrifying, more like gut-wrenching in how people would sacrifice themselves for others. I clearly needed something way lighter to cleanse my palate. That's when I stumbled on [A Stay-at-home Dad's Restaurant In An Alternate World](https://www.webnovel.com/book/a-stay-at-home-dad's-restaurant-in-an-alternate-world_9829507306003305), that was a light, easy read. But very frustratingly, it didn't have an ending. Can you understand that? like reaching for the "NEXT" button but nothing's there. It was close to finishing the thirst. I took the plunge and browsed Completed on b o x n o v e l. Finally, I landed on [Rebirth to a Military Marriage: Good Morning Chief](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/rebirth-to-a-military-marriage-good-morning-chief/). I felt complete, I felt really complete then. It was an amazing novel. An amazing amazing story.

PS: Wed Jun 1 2022, lol, let's also add [The Legendary Mechanic](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-legendary-mechanic/)

PPS: Sun Jun 26 2022, ok, let's really really end this binge-ing with [Tales of Herding Gods](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/tales-of-herding-gods/). Which is so good I would re-read and do a YouTube channel on it if I could.
