[I had nowhere to go](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5896594/) by Douglas Gordon is an audio experience where I wince as a man continually hack a beet dangerously close to his fingers and have a staring contest with a chimpanzee. Also, entirely carried by the tales of Jonas Mekas's escape from war-torn Europe and his early years in New York City.
