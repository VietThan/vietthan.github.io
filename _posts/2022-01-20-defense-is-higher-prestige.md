> defense orgs are viewed as higher-prestige than DAâ€™s offices and so tend to hire from among the top-ranked schools. To generalize broadly: the prosecutors office being a racially diverse set of first-generation lawyers from working-class neighborhoods with intimidate connections to crime and poverty, while the defenders are privileged Main Line and Westchester Ivy Leaguers putting in their stint of playing white savior in the big bad city before moving on to more lucrative fields. All you see in defense is Harvard, Columbia, Duke; all you see in the prosecution is Cardozo, St. Johns, Hofstra.
