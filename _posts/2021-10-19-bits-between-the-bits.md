[CppCon 2018: Matt Godbolt “The Bits Between the Bits: How We Get to main()”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOfucXtyEsU)

I was reminded of this video because of my fintech interviews (who love C++). Matt Godbolt is very famous in the C++ community, of course, because of his website [godbolt.org](https://godbolt.org/). And it's talk like this that shows why some people think C++ programmers are wizards, or insane to work with such a language.
