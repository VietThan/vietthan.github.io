I just want to post about this sexy beast that is currently situated at the Mono No Aware film lab in Brooklyn, New York. Let me try colorfully recount what Steve Cossman, Mono's director, tells me:

> This is 1 of 18 machines in the world. The hardware is handbuilt by one guy and the software is handbuilt by another.  Its full cost is \$250,000 but they made one at \$30,000 for Mono. It's got 32TB of hard drive temporarily as the guy will come next week to upgrade that. It's hooked up to a Windows PC that host the processing software, export to the data tower and we've got a Mac hooked up to _that_ for ease of data transport. Scans 8 frame a second at 4K resolution. We drove it to the lab in the middle of a snow squall, and I have to thank a cinematography.com guru for helping set it up for us.

That's it, just niche tech that most will not get to see. Unless they come to [Mono No Aware](http://mononoawarefilm.com/).
