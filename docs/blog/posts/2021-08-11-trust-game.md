> 'Fool me once, shame on...shame on you. Fool meâ€”you can't get fooled again.' - George W Bush

You can learn a lot from games, especially educational games. Luckilly for us, we have Nicky Case to thanks for her [trust game](https://ncase.me/trust/) to teach us how trust works in society. And who usually wins.

The 3 general rules as stated in the conclusion are:

> 1. REPEAT INTERACTIONS: Trust keeps a relationship going, but you need the knowledge of possible future repeat interactions before trust can evolve.
> 2. POSSIBLE WIN-WINS: You must be playing a non-zero-sum game, a game where it's at least possible that both players can be better off -- a win-win.
> 3. LOW MISCOMMUNICATION: If the level of miscommunication is too high, trust breaks down. But when there's a little bit of miscommunication, it pays to be more forgiving.

Rule 3 explains why there is lowered trust in the current media environment. When all you read about the other side is their hypocrisy and bad-faith actions, you'll very quickly lose trust on the other side.
