A month ago, Dropbox [released](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/sharing-our-engineering-career-framework-with-the-world) their career framework ("how do we determine you get promoted/raise?").

You can read it [here](https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/).

The [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27817519) was interesting, [/r/ExperiencedDev](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/oj94lm/dropbox_shares_their_engineering_career_framework/) also is interesting.

But personally, I'm just aiming to be on the ladder right now.

Also, how do they host it like that?
