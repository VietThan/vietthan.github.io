I feel anxious today. I feel anxious a lot actually. I feel as if I'm not as good as my peers. Or that I'm not achieving as much as them. Lot's of comparisons being made lately. But need to remind myself from time to time that it's all okay. It's okay. Take your time. My existence is but a blip on this world. Who remembers the richest family and people of the 18th century, that's right, not a lot.

I have a good life, a good gf, a good job. I'll be grateful. Not fully satisfied, but I'll always be grateful for what I have.
