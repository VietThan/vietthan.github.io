So I added categories. This allows people to read my blog specific categories if they want to.

Now I have to figure out how to make my header navigation bar.

Hacked together with tutorials from [Webjeda](https://blog.webjeda.com/jekyll-categories/) and [Azure Patterns](https://www.azurepatterns.com/2020/03/11/jekyll-categories). 

Edit: And reading the jekyll [theme docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/).
