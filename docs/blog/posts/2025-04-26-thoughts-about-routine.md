# Thoughts about routine

I've recently gotten into running. It was slow progress. I skipped most days. But every week I do go run once. I think it does help my mood. Early on, I definitely had the New Year Resolution feel where I almost ran every 2 days. But anyway, what's important is that I'm still barely keeping up with it. I've slowly introduced other things. I started doing dead hangs and active hangs, just 20-30 seconds. I then started lateral raises because I heard it's good for my physique. Then I now do standing tricep dumbbell extensions (?). I am totally not doing exercise in any scientific way, but I think it's about habit building a bit. 

It is very easy to lose your routine. I like to blame others, but at the end of the day, it's me who needs to keep it. What I really need is just 150 minutes of exercises a week (2h30m/w)

I feel frustrated because routine and good habits doesn't come easy. I also wishes for the positive effects exercise would have on me (physiological, mental, attractiveness, etc.), but why must good things be so hard? 

This is just a rant, but it's about making sure I keep going.
