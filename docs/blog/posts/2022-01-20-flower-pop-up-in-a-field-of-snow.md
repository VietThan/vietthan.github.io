> I had a similar transition in my walk with Christ. While others claim grandiose visions and moments of overwhelming emotion as their conversion experiences, I feel my God seemingly did not come to me in such a manner. Instead, I simply... started caring one day about God and His will, realizing that I needed to seek His desires over my own, in a change so sudden that I myself didn't even notice it at first. Like... seeing a flower pop up in a field of snow, not there until it is suddenly very much there.
