> "Man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest." - Denis Diderot

"Denis Diderot (/ˈdiːdəroʊ/;[3] French: [dəni did(ə)ʁo]; 5 October 1713 – 31 July 1784) was a French philosopher, art critic, and writer, best known for serving as co-founder, chief editor, and contributor to the Encyclopédie"

Philosophers are very opinionated.
